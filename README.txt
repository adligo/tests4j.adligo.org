ok yet another testing framework for java.
I really didn't want to write one, but I fear the junit community
will not want to track statistics at the level I want to, so here we go.

I will probably never implement this project completely, as it is 
mostly for my thoughts on how I would rewrite junit from scratch.
But it may become a full blown project at some point.

Requirements of this project
1) No Dependencies!
2) Uml diagrams are roughly as important as the code
3) Assertion api that will be compatible with GWT and JSE (and perhaps JME)
4) Statistics of testing are important
5) Code Coverage is a 1.0 goal of this project
