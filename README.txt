Requirements of this project
1) No Dependencies!
2) Uml diagrams are roughly as important as the code
3) Assertion api that will be compatible with GWT, codenameone (desktop, iPhone) and JSE ,
    I am not planning to support JME, unless it starts to allow the GWT emulation classes 
    		(Enum, List, Map, Annotations, Generics exc).
    		


Check-in procedure;
1) Run org.adligo.test4J_tests.RunAllTrials in the tests4j_tests project at least 3x
2) Run tests4j_4gwt (Compile it into javascript) and run it on a few browsers (Firefox, Chrome, and Safari or IE) at least 3x
