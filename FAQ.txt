Why is there a java v1_6 package?
  At the time of this writing, GWT was seemingly based on 1.6 
they were updating to 1.7 on the docs.  In addition older versions
of java allow consumer users to use the older version with out needing
to upgrade.  Also for testing java 1.6 even though it has been 
end of life cycled.

Tests4j will not work without modification on JDK 1.6 because of usage
of jaxb for xml io, if you add jaxb to the ${JAVA_HOME} and
add it to the tests4j class path it may work when run using some jdk 1.6.

the files under src/org/adligo/tests4j/run/xml/io
were created by jaxb using this command line command
xjc.sh src/org/adligo/tests4j/run/xml -d src
